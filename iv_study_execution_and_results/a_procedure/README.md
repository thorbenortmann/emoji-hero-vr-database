# IV.A. Procedure

Our paper mentions that we assessed the game experience and feelings of VR sickness via the
Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) and the Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire (VRSQ)
but does not report any results.

We reported these results in a separate demo paper,
`EmojiHeroVR: A Virtual Reality Game for Collecting Partially Occluded Emotional Faces`,
which was also accepted for the
[12th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII 2024)](https://acii-conf.net/2024/).
