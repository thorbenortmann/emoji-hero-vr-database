# VII.A. Database Preparation

The artificial occlusions described in this subsection were done similarly to subsection III.B. (see
[occlude_images.py](./../../iii_study_preparation/b_facial_expression_recognition_model/occlude_images.py)).

The preparation of `EmoHeVRDB` is described in directory
[vi_database_construction/b_construction_and_statistics](../../vi_database_construction/b_construction_and_statistics)
of this repository.
Effectively, we used `EmoHeVRDB-SI` (see [1. EmoHeVRDB-SI](../../README.md#1-emohevrdb-si)) for our experiments.
