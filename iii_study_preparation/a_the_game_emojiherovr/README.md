EmojiHeroVR's source code is available in the following repository:
https://github.com/MirCore/EmojiHeroVR.
We tagged the exact version, we used during our study, with `study-setup`:
https://github.com/MirCore/EmojiHeroVR/tree/study-setup.

The [study-setup](https://github.com/MirCore/EmojiHeroVR/tree/study-setup.) version sends HTTP-POST requests
to an external Python webservice for Facial Expression Recognition (FER).
The exact version of the Python webservice and the FER models used can be found in the
[study-setup branch](https://github.com/thorbenortmann/facial-expression-recognition-microservice/tree/study-setup)
of our
[facial-expression-recognition-microservice](https://github.com/thorbenortmann/facial-expression-recognition-microservice)
GitHub repository.
